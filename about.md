Welcome to my webpage. 

I  am an  aspiring  data  scientist who  recently  received  a PhD  in
geophysics/planetary science.  During this  PhD, I developed  a strong
taste for data science and I am now looking forward to be part of such
exiting community.

## PhD Thesis

During  my   PhD,  I  investigated  shallow   magmatic  intrusions  on
terrestrial planets.  A magmatic intrusion is a solified rock that was
once a batch of magma that cools and solidifies within the crust.  For
instance,  the whole  Sierra Nevada  in  california is  the result  of
magmatic intrusion  accreations over a  100 millions years  time span.
Actually, most  of the  magma which  is produced  in the  Earth mantle
remains trap at depth where it cools and solifieds; volcanoes are only
a glimpse in the Earth magmatism.

Therefore, those magmatic intrusions represent  a major process in the
formation of terrestrial crust and better constraining their formation
can bring us crucial information in the understanding of terrestrial
planet formations.
