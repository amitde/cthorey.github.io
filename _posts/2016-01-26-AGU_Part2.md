title: "AGU fall meeting - Part 2 : Exploratory analysis"
published: true

American  Geophysical Union  (AGU) meeting  is a  geoscience conference
hold  each year  around Christmas  in San  Francisco. It  represents a
great opportunity for PhD students like  me to show off their work and
enjoy what the west coast has to offer.

However, with  nearly 24 000 attendees,  AGU Fall Meeting is  also the
largest Earth  and space  science meeting  in the  world. As  such, it
represents an interesting data set to dive into the geoscience academic
world.  In this post, I explore the data set collected in the previous
post.

## Organization of the meeting

For a  new attendee like me  two years ago, the  amount of information
available is  clearly overwhelming.  For instance,  nearly 3500 poster
and 1000 oral presentations are scheduled every day of the conference.
As each oral presenter is offered  a 15 min time slot, this represents
250  hours  of   talks  and,  assuming  a  reasonable   15  slides  by
presentations, nearly 15000 slides of geoscience stuff, i.e.  a lot to
process for a single human being ;)

Nevertheless,  the organization  of the  conference makes  it easy  to
focus  on  specific field  of  interest.   Indeed, the  conference  is
organized by sessions, themselves organized into 27 different sections
which cover almost  every possible geoscience subject,  from the fluid
dynamics of the  inner core in the Earth deep  interior section to the
formation of terrestrial planets if the planetary science one.

Sessions are proposed by conveners and are scheduled in the conference
if  they manage  to gather  a sufficient  number of  abstracts.  If  a
session does so,  it is granted with  a 2 hours time slot  for an oral
session and a 4 hours slot  for a poster presentation. The decision of
whether each contribution goes in the oral or the poster slot is taken
by the session conveners. In  particular, an oral awarded contribution
will get a  15 min time slot  to convince other fellows  of their good
work.

## Trendy topics

The number of sessions by section can first be used as a proxy for the
popularity  of  each  field.  For  instance,  this  year,  atmospheric
processes, hydrology  and biogeoscences host the  most sessions during
the week.

Nevertheless,  the  number  of  contributions  by  sessions  can  vary
significantly and the total number of contributors in each section may
give us a better measure for  the popularity of each field.  Note that
these numbers, which  sum to nearly 100000, are  not representative of
the size of the geoscience community as one contributor is more likely
to contribute  many times.  Indeed,  the average number of  authors by
contribution is close  to 4 which, assuming that everybody  get to the
conference, project roughly to the number of attendes, i.e. 25000.

Atmospheric  science is  the  most popular  topics  in the  geoscience
academic world  for the  past two  years.  It  is closely  followed by
hydrology and  bio-geosciences. Together, these three  thematics count
for nearly 35% of all AGU  contributors (which is redundant as we have
seen already,  but still) in 2015  and clearly dominates, by  far, the
rest of  the fields. It  would be interesting  to see if  the research
thematic  funding   distribution  in   geoscience  follows   the  same
distribution. I suppose that should be the case though.

Also worth noticing,  Global Environmental Change is also  part of the
top 5. Given the increasing importance of this thematic throughout our
society, this  is actually not  surprising.  Taking a closer  look, we
can see that an important part  of the research investigations in this
field focus of renewable every (4.7% of all the contributions), carbon
sequestration-related  problem (about  7%) and  global climate-related
changes.

2015 has also been a year of many exiting results in planetary science
(which  is closely  related to  my PhD  subject by  the way)  with the
release of very interesting data  from many different spacecraft. This
is again  nicely reflected in  the conference. The three  first ranked
session are  indeed dealing  with important planetary  science mission
which gives results this year

- The MAVEN mission from NASA which investigates the martian atmosphere
- The Rosetta  mission from ESA  which, after 10 years  of inactivity,
  wakes  up   and  manage  its   rendezvous  with  the   comete  Chury
  (Churyumov-Gerasimenko).
- The Dawn mission from NASA which investigates two of the three known
  protoplanets of the asteroid belt, Vesta and Ceres.
