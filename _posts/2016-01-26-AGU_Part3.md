American  Geophiscal Union  (AGU) meeting  is a  geocsience conference
hold  each year  around christmas  in San  Francisco. It  represents a
great oppportunity for phd students like  me to show off their work and
enjoy what the west coast has to offer.

However, with  nearly 24 000 attendees,  AGU Fall Meeting is  also the
largest Earth  and space  science meeting  in the  world. As  such, it
represents an interesting dataset to  explore what's trendy and what's
not in  the geocsience academic  world. This  year, I decided  to step
back  and  look  at the  mix  of  more  than  23,000 oral  and  poster
presentations from the data science perspective.

In this post, I explore the dataset collected in the previous post.
